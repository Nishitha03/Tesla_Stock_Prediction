# Stock Prediction Analysis

This project involves stock prediction using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The notebook contains code for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. The following libraries are required:

- **Core Libraries**: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `re`, `string`
- **Natural Language Processing**: `nltk`, `transformers`, `demoji`
- **Machine Learning**: `scikit-learn`, `imbalanced-learn`, `tensorflow`, `keras`, `torch`
- **Data APIs**: `yfinance`, `praw`
- **Other**: `attr`

### Installing Dependencies

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn tensorflow keras torch transformers demoji yfinance praw attr
```
How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the notebook file Stock_Prediction (1).ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the cells in sequence to execute the analysis.

Notes:
Ensure you have access to the required data (e.g., financial data via yfinance and any text data for NLP tasks).
If using praw for Reddit data extraction, configure your Reddit API credentials.
